# Dashboard Issues

This is a repository that mirrors the private current dashboards to allow others who do not have the privilege to add issues to the private repository. 

## Issue Guidelines 
1) Issue title and details 
  
   * Make sure that the title is descriptive enough but not too descriptive. Describe the main issue the explain in the details. i.e. title = "CPE on the twitter page isn't correct" details = "The CPE on the Mount Nittany Twitter page for July is $2.50 and it should be 3.00"
   * Make sure that you include the client's account name and the exact problem 
   
 2) Assign the issue to the correct project
    * There are 8 separate "projects" for each of the dashboard. Add the issue to the project that you feel the issue most closely relates to. 
    * If it is a general problem or you don't know where to put the issue add it to the general project. 
    
  3) Assign the issue a label
  
      * The labels allow the developers to address the issues appropriately. If the issue is a bug label it as a bug. 
    
  
  4) Assign the issue a priority
      * This allows us to address the bugs in order of importance not chronologically. 
      * If there is no priority it will be assumed to have the lowest priority 
      * Add the priority in the details section as either high or low priority
